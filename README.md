## Abstract
 
Everyone knows and has used some logging framework, so less introduction is needed. This example tests for design, encapsulation.
 
## Requirements
 
1. The logger offers multiple log levels: Trace, Warning, Error, Fatal.
2. The logger allows multiple sinks, e. g., stdout/terminal, a file, a slow serial port, syslog, etc.
 
## Tasks
1. Implement the logger class which provides log methods;
2. Option to chose different sinks - Terminal or File
3. The logger offers multiple log levels: Trace, Warning, Error, Fatal.
